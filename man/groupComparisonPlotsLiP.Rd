\arguments{
\item{data}{name of the list with models, which can be the output of the
MSstatsLiP \code{\link[MSstatsLiP]{groupComparisonLiP}} function}

\item{type}{choice of visualization, one of VolcanoPlot or Heatmap}

\item{sig}{FDR cutoff for the adjusted p-values in heatmap and volcano plot.
level of significance for comparison plot. 100(1-sig)\% confidence interval
will be drawn. sig=0.05 is default.}

\item{FCcutoff}{or volcano plot or heatmap, whether involve fold change
cutoff or not. FALSE (default) means no fold change cutoff is applied for
significance analysis. FCcutoff = specific value means specific fold change
cutoff is applied.}

\item{logBase.pvalue}{for volcano plot or heatmap, (-) logarithm
transformation of adjusted p-value with base 2 or 10(default).}

\item{ylimUp}{for all three plots, upper limit for y-axis. FALSE (default)
for volcano plot/heatmap use maximum of -log2 (adjusted p-value) or -log10
(adjusted p-value). FALSE (default) for comparison plot uses maximum of
log-fold change + CI.}

\item{ylimDown}{for all three plots, lower limit for y-axis. FALSE (default)
for volcano plot/heatmap use minimum of -log2 (adjusted p-value) or -log10
(adjusted p-value). FALSE (default) for comparison plot uses minimum of
log-fold change - CI.}

\item{xlimUp}{for Volcano plot, the limit for x-axis. FALSE (default) for
use maximum for absolute value of log-fold change or 3 as default if maximum
for absolute value of log-fold change is less than 3.}

\item{x.axis.size}{size of axes labels, e.g. name of the comparisons in
heatmap, and in comparison plot. Default is 10.}

\item{y.axis.size}{size of axes labels, e.g. name of targeted proteins in
heatmap. Default is 10.}

\item{dot.size}{size of dots in volcano plot and comparison plot. Default is
3.}

\item{text.size}{size of ProteinName label in the graph for Volcano Plot.
Default is 4.}

\item{text.angle}{angle of x-axis labels represented each comparison at the
bottom of graph in comparison plot. Default is 0.}

\item{legend.size}{size of legend for color at the bottom of volcano plot.
Default is 7.}

\item{ProteinName}{for volcano plot only, whether display protein/peptide
names or not. TRUE (default) means protein names, which are significant, are
displayed next to the points. FALSE means no protein names are displayed.}

\item{colorkey}{TRUE(default) shows colorkey.}

\item{numProtein}{The number of proteins which will be presented in each
heatmap. Default is 50.}

\item{width}{width of the saved file. Default is 10.}

\item{height}{height of the saved file. Default is 10.}

\item{which.Comparison}{list of comparisons to draw plots. List can be
labels of comparisons or order numbers of comparisons from levels(data$Label)
, such as levels(testResultMultiComparisons$ComparisonResult$Label).
Default is "all", which generates all plots for each protein.}

\item{which.Protein}{Peptide list to draw comparison plots. List can be
names of Proteins/Peptides or order numbers of Proteins/Peptides from
levels(testResultMultiComparisons$ComparisonResult$Protein). Default is
"all", which generates all comparison plots for each protein.}

\item{address}{the name of folder that will store the results. Default
folder is the current working directory. The other assigned folder has to
be existed under the current working directory. An output pdf file is
automatically created with the default name of "VolcanoPlot.pdf" or
"Heatmap.pdf". The command address can help to specify where to store the
file as well as how to modify the beginning of the file name. If
address=FALSE, plot will be not saved as pdf file but showed in window}

\description{
To analyze the results of modeling changes in abundance of LiP peptides
and overall protein, groupComparisonPlotsLiP takes as input the results of
the groupComparisonLiP function. It asses the results of three models:
unadjusted LiP, adjusted LiP, and overall protein. To asses the results of
the model, the following visualizations can be created:
(1) VolcanoPlot (specify "VolcanoPlot" in option type), to plot peptides or
proteins and their significance for each model.
(2) Heatmap (specify "Heatmap" in option type), to evaluate the fold change
between conditions and peptides/proteins
